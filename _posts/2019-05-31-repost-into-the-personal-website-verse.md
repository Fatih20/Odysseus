# [Into the Personal-Website-Verse](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse)
This blogpost recommends embracing personal websites as an alternative to the pandora's box of social networking, and of particular interest me explores some options for decentralized discovery. This is very much the future I want to see for the Web, and I don't know what to add.

I kind of wish I did because discovery is a big topic, which I am just beginning to tackle in Odysseus.

P.S. I do have a [personal site](https://adrian.geek.nz/) but not a blog though. Though it is very on topic for this blog.
