# [Deconstructing Google’s excuses on tracking protection](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2019/08/23/deconstructing-googles-excuses-on-tracking-protection/)

It is no surprise that a company who makes their business by invading our privacy will make these sorts of excuses, and this article breaks them down very well. To be fair if it is possible to carry on targetted advertising whilst protecting privacy Differential Privacy is the way to do it, but that ignores the fact that personally targetted advertising is a concern in-and-of itself.

I think the best thing I can do on this issue is to explore and advocate more radical approaches to protecting privacy, but in the meantime Odysseus will inherit Apple's fine work on Safari privacy protections.
