# Odysseus web browser

A simple and performant yet powerful [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/)-[style](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines) window onto the open decentralized web.

Odysseus is already and will continue to be a convenient, privacy-respecting,
[ethically designed](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/), and opensource
(under the GPLv3+ license) web browser that should run great on any free desktop.
However work is ongoing to make Odysseus more convenient with handy navigation
aids that gently and unobtrusively guide you wherever you want to go online.

In doing so Odysseus aims to help you focus on the webpages that matter to you,
and to support the open decentralized web over the centralized services of today.
